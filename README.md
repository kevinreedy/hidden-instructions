# hidden-instructions
GitHub Copilot now allows you to add [custom instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot), so it can provide chat responses that are tailored to the way your team works, the tools you use, or the specifics of your project. There are ways to disguise text using unicode, so that it may not be visibile in some code editors or on github.com. This combination [has been highlighted as a potentail attack vector](https://www.pillar.security/blog/new-vulnerability-in-github-copilot-and-cursor-how-hackers-can-weaponize-code-agents). This repository is a test to see how this code can be hidden.
